                <h2>Our certificate & online program for 2022</h2>
                <p>A student is considered an ideal student if they are responsible for her studies and can pay good respect to teachers and elders. <br> a student is attentive in class and knows their responsibility well, she can be considered an ideal student.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Every child is born with some inborn qualities. No one is perfect in this world, but we can always appreciate someone’s good behaviour and manners.<br> An ideal student is one who is very humble and respectful towards their studies and respectful towards their elders. They must be loyal and trustworthy, which can be proved by their behaviour and attitude. Scoring higher marks is not something that matters in life. If you are a humble person and have a respectful attitude towards others, everyone will remember you for your entire life. An ideal student is attentive enough in class, dedicated to his or her studies, and always loved by the teachers. An ideal student motivates other children and maintains a positive atmosphere around them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>People think that a child who studies well is an ideal student, but in fact, an ideal student is one who is attentive in class, adores everyone, is very respectful and is hardworking and trustworthy.<br> An ideal student is not one who spends all the time with the notebooks but also participates in other co-curricular activities and various volunteer activities.</p>
                <br>
                <p>An ideal student is always disciplined and lives following conduct. He is always conscious of his duties and responsibilities towards his parents and elders.  He is truthful, generous, kind-hearted and optimistic. He has a quest for knowledge. He maintains good health and a sound mind.
                    An ideal student is persevering and consistent in his studies.  He is regular in his classes. He reads a lot of books other than academic books. An ideal student is always well mannered and sets examples for other students.  He takes part in extracurricular activities. He is an all-rounder in schools. Along with perseverance, he is also a hardworking student. Hard work and consistency go hand in hand. Without hard work, one can never climb the ladder of success.                     
                    An ideal student knows the value of time, unless he realizes how precious time is, he will not be able to master himself. If he lacks this quality, he will fail to realize his goals. Time never stops for anyone. Next, he is always obedient and broad-minded. He follows instructions from his teacher and allows himself to be corrected and reformed for betterment.   <br> 
                    An ideal student is always humble. Only if he is humble, he will be able to learn, be obedient and will gain the knowledge and the skills imparted by his parents or teachers.   <br>               
                    An ideal student is responsible. Without having the capability to shoulder the responsibility regarding anything, a student will not be able to achieve anything worthwhile in life. Only a responsible person can carry forward the greater responsibility of being a good citizen, a good person or even for that matter the responsibility of a family. 
              <br> ideal student is never selfish. He is always very helpful and generous. Knowledge is said, increase only by sharing. He will always help his fellow students. He is full of humility and will never know what pride, conceit, vanity or selfishness is.      
                    An ideal student will have a keen observation and a seeker. Only a curious mind will seek new things and like to learn novel concepts as only a keen observer can acquire knowledge of new things. <br>
                    An ideal student is always robust and fits to have a good concentration and to work hard. He, therefore, keeps himself fit by exercising regularly. Exercise increases his capacity to concentrate, makes him disciplined and orderly. <br>
                    An ideal student respects and obeys the laws of his country. He has all the qualities of a good citizen. He has respect for all religions. He has a passion for serving his motherland. He never tells lies and he doesn’t betray anyone. He fights against social evils         <br>        
                    As we all know a disciplined student is always successful. Finally, an ideal student is also respectful. He who has no respect, knows no knowledge, is a maxim. One cannot progress without the blessings of his teachers and elders, which he earns only when he possesses all the above qualities.</p>
